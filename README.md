# The Rise of E-Sports

With the recent growth of e-sports as a new and exciting form of entertainment, we wanted to explore how the flow of money through this market has changed over time. Over the past 20 years, e-sports has seen a meteoric increase and popularity and monetary backing- whether that be through tournaments or sponsorship deals from large coporations such as Nike, Red Bull, and Comcast, among others. As such, we wanted to evaulate these trends through the form of an interactive data visualization dashboard. To do so, we created a python flask application with endpoints containing json data pulled from a Postgres database populated with cleaned and formatted data from our various datasets. Finally, we deployed our dashboard application through Heroku.
